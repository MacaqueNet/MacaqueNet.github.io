MacaqueNet has received many generous data contributions from macaque researches all over the world. 
Some of these datasets, particularly those they are older, require digitizing before they can be standardised and imported into the database. 

Here is where you come in... We need volunteers to digitizing one or more behavioural datasets. It could make an ideal student project or for those wanting experience handling behavioural data.

Interested in digitizing some macaque data? Click the button below and fill in the form. We will get in touch ASAP.
