      MacaqueNet relies on the generous data contributions from researchers around the world. Some of these valuable datasets — especially older ones — still exist only in handwritten or scanned formats and need to be digitized and reformatted before they can be standardised and added to the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>That is where you come in!</strong> Want to become a member of the MacaqueNet consortium? We are looking for volunteers to help digitize or process one or more behavioural macaque datasets. 
      Whether you are a student, early-career researcher, or just looking for a meaningful side project, this is a fantastic opportunity to gain experience working with large, real-world datasets.
      No previous experience is necessary — the MacaqueNet Management Team will provide full training and guidance in data handling and manipulation using tools such as Microsoft Office and R — all of which look great on a CV!

      Datasets may include interactions of grooming, aggression, proximity or body contact, and many have full demographic and observation effort for all subjects. These data might just be the exact species, population or behaviours you are interested in studying. 
      Once digitized and added to the database, many of these datasets will be made openly accessible and available for collaboration with the MacaqueNet consortium.

  There may be opportunities to help digitize and/or process the following datasets:
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Rhesus macaques</strong></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0;">
  <li>Data collected via focal follows across three years from two groups in a free-ranging population.</li>
  <li>Both social (e.g. grooming, proximity, body-contact, aggression, sexual) and non-social (e.g. feeding, travel, rest, self-directed) behaviours were recorded.</li>
</ul>



<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Long-tailed macaques</strong></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0;">
  <li>
    Data from two wild, provisioned populations. Individually recognizable subjects were observed via focal follows. Both social (e.g. grooming, proximity, body-contact, aggression, sexual) and non-social (e.g. feeding, travel, rest) behaviours were recorded.
    <ul>
      <li>Population 1: Focal follow data from a single wild, provisioned social group across the wet and dry season, spanning nine months.</li>
      <li>Population 2: Focal follow data from four social groups across seven years.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Bonnet macaques</strong></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0;">
  <li>Focal observation data from two captive groups, across three years.</li>
  <li>Data includes grooming interactions and dominance hierarchies.</li>
</ul>
