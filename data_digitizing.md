MacaqueNet relies on the generous data contributions from researchers around the world. Some of these valuable datasets — especially older ones — still exist only in handwritten or scanned formats and need to be digitized before they can be standardised and added to the database.

That is where you come in!

We are looking for volunteers to help digitize one or more behavioural macaque datasets. 
This is a great opportunity for students or anyone interested in gaining experience with real-world behavioural data handling. 

Whether you are looking for a project to complement your studies or simply want to get involved in comparative research, we would love to hear from you.

There may be opportunities to help digitize behavioural datasets for the following species:
* long-tailed macaques 
* rhesus macaques

These datasets could include observations of grooming, agonism, or body contact, and might just involve the ideal species, populations or behaviours you need to answer your own research question! 
Once the data is digitized and imported into the database, you will have the opportunity to request to use these data, in collaboration with the MacaqueNet consortium, with permission of the original data contributors.
